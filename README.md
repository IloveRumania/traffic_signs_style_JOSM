# traffic_signs_style_JOSM
Translated project from JOSM Styles due to exceed limit and expand to other countries.

IMPORTANT:
I'm sad to announce I cannot make test on JOSM anymore (JOSM people warned me) so I cannot update anymore Traffic signs and style preset for JOSM (until I would had a country or a page of taginfo).You can download the betas here:
